## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here. 
> The data contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc!

- What is the background of your project?
>  Lending Club Case Study: This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures.     Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the    largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
> Our business problem is to develop your understanding of the domain, you are advised to independently research a little about risk analytics (understanding the types of variables and their significance should be enough).
>  Most of the loans taken for debt consolidation(47%) and Credit card bill payment & Other is also one of the main area where loans were taken.
> 82.96 percent loans were fully paid & Close to 14% loans were charged off!
- What is the dataset that is being used?
